7. So I searched “eclipse use spring boot”, and I found a keyword called “Spring Tools for Eclipse IDE | The Eclipse Foundation”  , click it , I go into a website, its 
https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2018/february/springboot.php
and I found this sentence,
“In case you prefer to use a ready-to-use distribution, you can go to https://spring.io/tools and download the Spring Tool Suite distribution, which is a full Eclipse distribution (based on the latest Eclipse release) with Spring Tools pre-installed.”

8. So I go to the website and downloaded it,
 
9. This is the downloaded file,
 
10. Unzip it, and click this icon,
 
11. A new window will be open,
 
12. This time I can create spring project now!  Done !
